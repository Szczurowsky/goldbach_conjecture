# goldbach_conjecture
Well this is a simple program that tries to deny the Goldbach conjecture.
Since the Goldbach conjecture is not proven, and it would be hard to prove it by programming, I decided to try to deny
it, because it's just brute force.

#### I will update it when I have time, and I will try to make it faster.
##### You can also help me by making a pull request.

## What is the Goldbach conjecture?
The Goldbach conjecture is a conjecture that says that every even number greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two.

## How does this program work?
This program is very simple, it just tries to find a number that can't be written as the sum of two primes.

## License
This program is licensed under the MIT license. See the LICENSE file for more information.

## Note from the author
If you somehow manage to run it for long enough, and you find a number that can't be written as the sum of two primes,
you can mention me because why not, that would be weird flex, doesn't it?
